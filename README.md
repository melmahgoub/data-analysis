### Time Series Analysis (October 2019)

hands-on experience working on an end-to-end time series analysis and forecasting solution using the well-established technique of ARIMA modeling. Explored the time series data set to determine if trend, seasonality and stationarity. Performing diagnostics, to make a visual judgement on the best model hyperparameters to guide my initial approach. Finally, performed a grid search on the model hyperparameters to determine the best model and evaluate its performance.
